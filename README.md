# Bible Kings Timeline

This project provides a small React application that visualizes the kings of Israel and Judah from 931 BC to 586 BC. The app uses React and Babel from public CDNs so no build step is required.

Open `index.html` in a web browser or host it on GitHub Pages to view the timeline.
